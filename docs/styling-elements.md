# Styling elements

Campfire's visual components expose classes prefixed with `campfire-` that include no default styles, giving you full control over their appearance:

- `.campfire-link` – buttons generated from Twine `[[Link]]` syntax
- `.campfire-trigger` – buttons created by the trigger directive

Each class ships with no associated styles. Customize them in your own stylesheets to theme the interface.
